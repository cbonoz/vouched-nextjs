              Endorsements are a way to vouch for someone you know. When you
              endorse someone, you are saying that you trust them. You can
              endorse someone for a specific skill, or for their character.

            <div>
              A profile page is defined by a unique handle you can define from
              the Manage tab. You can share your profile page with others, and
              they can request access to your endorsement or vouch network using
              terms of access that you specify (ex: 10% fee if you hire someone
              from my network, I get a return favor X, etc.).

              In order to vouch for someone, you must be logged in and your
              account must also be active. Users requesting access to your
